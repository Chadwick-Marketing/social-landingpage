                    to the data protection regulations of the General Data
                    Protection Regulation, national regulations on data
                    protection apply in Germany. These include, in particular,
                    the Act on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in
                    Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In
                    particular, the BDSG contains special regulations on the
                    right to information, the right to erasure, the right to
                    object, the processing of special categories of personal
                    data, the processing for other purposes and the transmission
                    as well as automated decision-making in individual cases
                    including profiling. Furthermore, it regulates data
                    processing for employment purposes (Section 26 BDSG), in
                    particular with regard to the establishment, performance or
                    termination of employment relationships as well as the
                    consent of employees. Furthermore, state data protection
                    laws of the individual federal states may apply.

                    If it is possible for us to do so or if it is not necessary
                    to store the IP address, we shorten or have your IP address

                    as "IP masking", the last octet, i.e. the last two numbers
                    of an IP address, is deleted (in this context, the IP
                    address is an identifier individually assigned to an
                    Internet connection by the online access provider). The
                    shortening of the IP address is intended to prevent or make
                    it significantly more difficult to identify a person by
                    their IP address. <br />

                    In order to provide our online offer securely and
                    efficiently, we use the services of one or more web hosting
                    providers from whose servers (or servers managed by them)
                    the online offer can be accessed. For these purposes, we may
                    use infrastructure and platform services, computing
                    capacity, storage space and database services as well as
                    security services and technical maintenance services. <br />
                    <br />
                    The data processed in the context of the provision of the
                    hosting offer may include all information relating to the
                    users of our online offer, which is generated in the context
                    of use and communication. This regularly includes the IP
                    address, which is necessary to be able to deliver the
                    contents of online offers to browsers, and all entries made
                    within our online offer or from websites. <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Email sending and hosting:</strong>
                    The web hosting services we use also include the sending,
                    receiving and storing of e-mails. For these purposes, the
                    addresses of the recipients and senders as well as further
                    information regarding the e-mail dispatch (e.g. the
                    providers involved) and the contents of the respective
                    e-mails are processed. The aforementioned data may also be
                    processed for the purpose of identifying SPAM. Please note
                    that e-mails on the Internet are generally not sent in
                    encrypted form. As a rule, e-mails are encrypted in transit,
                    but (unless a so-called end-to-end encryption method is
                    used) not on the servers from which they are sent and
                    received. We can therefore not assume any responsibility for
                    the transmission path of the e-mails between the sender and
                    the reception on our server. <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Collection of access data and log files:</strong>
                    We ourselves (or our web hosting provider) collect data on
                    each access to the server (so-called server log files). The
                    server log files may include the address and name of the web
                    pages and files accessed, date and time of access, data
                    volumes transferred, notification of successful access,
                    browser type and version, the user's operating system,
                    referrer URL (the previously visited page) and, as a rule,
                    IP addresses and the requesting provider. <br />
                    <br />
                    The server log files can be used for security purposes, e.g.
                    to avoid overloading the servers (especially in the case of
                    abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks) and to ensure the
                    utilization of the servers and their stability. <br />

                    optimising the respective services and for security
                    purposes. Likewise, the metadata of the communication via
                    chat services (i.e., for example, the information about who
                    communicated with whom) could be used by the respective
                    platform providers in accordance with their provisions, to
                    which we refer for further information, for marketing
                    purposes or to display advertising tailored to users. <br />
                    <br />
                    If users agree with a chatbot to activate information with
                    regular messages, they have the option to unsubscribe from
                    the information at any time in the future. The chatbot
                    informs users how and with which terms they can unsubscribe
                    from the messages. By unsubscribing from the chatbot
                    messages, users' data is deleted from the list of message
                    recipients. <br />
                    <br />
                    We use the foregoing information to operate our chat
                    services, such as to personally address users, to respond to
                    their inquiries, to deliver any requested content, and also
                    to improve our chat services (e.g., to "teach" chatbots
                    answers to frequently asked questions or to recognize
                    unanswered inquiries). <br />
                    <br />
                    Notes on legal basis: We use chat services on the basis of
                    consent if we have previously obtained users' permission to
                    process their data within the scope of our chat services
                    (this applies to cases where users are asked for consent,
                    e.g. for a chatbot to send them messages on a regular
                    basis). Where we use chat services to respond to users'
                    queries about our services or our business, this is for
                    contractual and pre-contractual communication. Otherwise, we
                    use chat services on the basis of our legitimate interests
                    in optimising the chat services, their operational
                    efficiency and increasing the positive user experience.{' '}

                  <div className="-legal-paragraph">
                    We process personal data for online marketing purposes,
                    which includes, in particular, the marketing of advertising
                    space or display of promotional and other content
                    (collectively, "Content") based on the potential interests
                    of users and measuring its effectiveness. <br />
                    <br />
                    For these purposes, so-called user profiles are created and
                    stored in a file (so-called "cookie") or similar procedures
                    are used, by means of which the information about the user
                    relevant for the presentation of the aforementioned content
                    is stored. This information may include, for example,
                    content viewed, websites visited, online networks used, but
                    also communication partners and technical information such
                    as the browser used, the computer system used and
                    information on usage times. If users have consented to the
                    collection of their location data, this may also be
                    processed. <br />
                    <br />
                    The IP addresses of the users are also stored. However, we
                    use available IP masking procedures (i.e., pseudonymization
                    by shortening the IP address) to protect users. In general,
                    no clear user data (such as e-mail addresses or names) is
                    stored as part of the online marketing process, but
                    pseudonyms. This means that we as well as the providers of
                    the online marketing procedures do not know the actual
                    identity of the users, but only the information stored in
                    their profiles. <br />
                    <br />
                    The information in the profiles is usually stored in the
                    cookies or by means of similar procedures. These cookies can
                    later generally also be read on other websites that use the
                    same online marketing procedure and analysed for the purpose
                    of displaying content as well as supplemented with further
                    data and stored on the server of the online marketing
                    procedure provider. <br />
                    <br />
                    Exceptionally, clear data may be associated with the
                    profiles. This is the case, for example, if the users are
                    members of a social network whose online marketing
                    procedures we use and the network links the profiles of the
                    users with the aforementioned data. We ask you to note that
                    users can make additional agreements with the providers,
                    e.g. by giving their consent as part of the registration
                    process. <br />
                    <br />
                    In principle, we only receive access to summarized
                    information about the success of our advertisements.
                    However, in the context of so-called conversion
                    measurements, we can check which of our online marketing
                    methods have led to a so-called conversion, i.e., for
                    example, to a conclusion of a contract with us. The
                    conversion measurement is used solely to analyse the success
                    of our marketing measures. <br />
                    <br />
                    Unless otherwise stated, we ask you to assume that cookies
                    used will be stored for a period of two years. <br />
                    <br />
                    Notes on legal bases: Where we ask users for their consent
                    to use third-party providers, the legal basis for processing
                    data is consent. Otherwise, users' data is processed on the
                    basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in
                    efficient, economic and recipient-friendly services). In
                    this context, we would also like to refer you to the
                    information on the use of cookies in this privacy policy.{' '}

                    processed for market research and advertising purposes. For
                    example, usage profiles can be created based on the usage
                    behavior and resulting interests of the users. The usage
                    profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place
                    advertisements within and outside of the networks that are
                    presumably correspond to the interests of the users. For
                    these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the computers
                    of the users, in which the usage behaviour and the interests
                    of the users are stored. Furthermore, data may also be
                    stored in the usage profiles regardless of the devices used
                    by the users (especially if the users are members of the
                    respective platforms and are logged in to them). <br />

                    Also in the case of requests for information and the
                    assertion of data subject rights, we point out that these
                    can be asserted most effectively with the providers. Only
                    the providers have access to the users' data and can take
                    appropriate measures and provide information directly. If
                    you still need help, you can contact us. <br />

                    Ltd for collecting (but not further processing) data from
                    visitors to our Facebook page (known as a "Fan Page"). This
                    data includes information about the types of content users
                    view or interact with, or the actions they take (see "Things

                    "Device Information" in the Facebook Data Policy Statement:

                    to provide analytics services, called "Page Insights," to
                    Page operators to provide them with insights into how people
                    interact with their Pages and the content associated with
                    them. We have entered into a special agreement with Facebook

                    https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum),
                    which in particular regulates which security measures
                    Facebook must observe and in which Facebook has agreed to
                    fulfil the data subject rights (i.e. users can, for example,
                    send information or deletion requests directly to Facebook).
                    The rights of users (in particular to information, deletion,
                    objection and complaint to the competent supervisory
                    authority), are governed by the agreements with  Facebook

                    social media buttons and posts (hereinafter uniformly
                    referred to as "content"). <br />
                    <br />
                    The integration always requires that the third-party
                    providers of this content process the IP address of the
                    user, as without the IP address they could not send the
                    content to their browser. The IP address is thus essential
                    for the display of this content or functions required. We
                    strive to use only such content whose respective providers
                    use the IP address only for the delivery of the content.
                    Third-party providers may also use so-called pixel tags
                    (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for
                    statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be
                    used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the
                    pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also
                    be stored in cookies on the user's device and may contain,
                    among other things, technical information about the browser
                    and operating system, referring websites, time of visit and
                    other information about the use of our online offer as well

                    Notes on legal bases: Where we ask users for their consent
                    to use third-party providers, the legal basis for processing
                    data is consent. Otherwise, users' data is processed on the

                        One speaks of "remarketing" or "retargeting" when, for

                        has chosen on a website. website has interested the user

                        advertisements.

                        <strong>Tracking:</strong>
                        We speak of "tracking" when the behaviour of users can
                        be traced across several online services. As a rule,
                        behavioural and interest information with regard to the
                        online offers used is stored in cookies or on servers of
                        the providers of the tracking technologies (so-called
                        profiling). This information can then be used, for
                        example, to display advertisements to users that are
                        likely to correspond to their interests.

                    a cookie is to store information about a user during or
                    after his visit within an online offer. Stored information

                    The term cookies also includes other technologies that

                    The legal basis on which we process your personal data using

                    basis for the processing of your data is the declared
                    consent. Otherwise, the data processed with the help of
                    cookies is processed on the basis of our legitimate
                    interests (e.g. in a business operation of our online offer

                    Depending on whether the processing is based on consent or
                    legal permission, you have the option at any time to revoke
                    any consent given or to object to the processing of your
                    data by cookie technologies (collectively referred to as
                    "opt-out"). You can initially declare your objection by
                    means of your browser settings, e.g. by deactivating the use
                    of cookies (whereby this may also restrict the functionality
                    of our online offer). An objection to the use of cookies for
                    online marketing purposes can also be declared by means of a

                    providers named in the cookie consent management procedure
