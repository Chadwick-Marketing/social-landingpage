        question: 'What is a link in bio?',
        answer:
          'On platforms like Instagram and others, you are only allowed to provide one link in your profile. But if you want to share multiple links with your fans, for example your latest blog post or a specific product of yours, a link-in bio page helps you do that. The link-in-bio page lists all your links. You can add them to your profile and avoid the problem of only being able to link to one link. ',
      },
      {
        question: 'Why should I build my link in bio with Social?',
        answer:
          'Of course, there are already some providers that offer similar functionality to Social. However, there is one major drawback: all of these tools are not installed on your website. Not only do you give away your reach to third-party sites that earn money with your content - you are also not on the safe side in terms of data protection. If you have your own website, it only makes sense to use it for your link-in bio. Plus, there are the many connections and integrations that allow you to install it directly on your website. ',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I customize the look of my link in bio?',
        answer:
          'Of course. The free version of Social offers you a variety of pre-created themes that you can use to customize your link-in-bio page. If you upgrade to Social Pro, you can create your own themes and customize backgrounds, fonts, link styles, and more.',

        question: 'What platforms is Social available for?',
        answer:
          'Social is available for WordPress, so it integrates directly with your website. Thus, your own domain can be used for link in bio pages.',
